# Learning stuff
Still don't have an exact plan what i am going to do here, but i definately would use:
- terraform
- github actions
- azure? i wanted to invest myself in aws but amazon doesn`t want to verify my free trial account
- ansible/jenkins
- something about monitoring

A lot of stupid mistakes but i don't know a person that don't make mistakes while learning.
